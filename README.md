The Arduino_UnifiedStorage library provides a unified interface to access different types of storage, including internal storage, SD cards, and USB mass storage devices. It simplifies the handling of files and directories across multiple storage mediums on Portenta, Opta, and some Nicla boards.


## Examples
* [**examples/SimpleStorageWriteRead**](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_UnifiedStorage/blob/main/examples/SimpleStorageWriteRead/SimpleStorageWriteRead.ino) - Write/read simple data from &sd, USB and internal storage
* [**examples/AdvancedUSBInternalOperations**](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_UnifiedStorage/blob/main/examples/AdvancedUSBInternalOperations/AdvancedUSBInternalOperations.ino) - Navigate file structure and demonstrate file operations between USB and internal storage
* [**examples/BackupInternalPartitions**](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_UnifiedStorage/blob/main/examples/BackupInternalPartitions/BackupInternalPartitions.ino) - Back up all partitions on the internal storage to a USB Mass Storage device.

## ðŸ‘€ Instructions
1. Download and install this library 
2. Check compatibility with your platform



## âœ¨ Features
* Access files and directories on internal storage, SD cards, and USB mass storage devices.
* Read and write data to files.
* Create, remove, and rename files and directories.
* Copy and move files and directories.
* List files and subfolders in a directory.
* Manipulate files and folders from one storage medium to another
* Format partitions and drives (FAT and LittleFS)
* Create and modify partitions on the internal storage

## Compatibility
This library has been tested with the following STM32 and Renesas based Arduino boards. The availability of storage mediums depends on the hardware interfaces:
* Portenta Machine Control: USB and Internal QSPI Flash
* Portenta H7 + Portenta Breakout: USB, &sd, and QSPI
* Portenta H7 + Vision Shield: SD and QSPI
* Portenta C33 + Portenta Breakout: USB, &sd, and QSPI
* Portenta C33 + Vision Shield: SD and QSPI
* Opta: Internal QSPI Flash and USB


Note: Due to an unforeseen compatibility issue on the Portenta Breakout Board, inserting a USB drive on the USB-A port of the breakout board may occasionally cause a reboot on Portenta C33 boards. You can work around this issue by connecting your USB Mass Storage device through a USB hub. This limitation only affects Portenta C33 boards.
